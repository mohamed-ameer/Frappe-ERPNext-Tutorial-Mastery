Almost any business app!

- **ERP Systems** (like ERPNext – accounting, inventory, HR)
- **CRM** (Customer Relationship Management)

## The Magic: DocTypes

The heart of Frappe is the **DocType**.

A **DocType** is a blueprint for data. For example:
- `Customer` (a type of document)
- `Sales Order` (another document type)

Each DocType automatically gives you:
- A **database table**
- A **form to fill out**
- A **list view**
- **Permissions, workflows, and APIs**

You define the structure (e.g., fields like name, email), and Frappe builds everything else.

## Real-World Example: ERPNext

**ERPNext** is the most popular app built on Frappe.

It’s a full business management system used by thousands of companies worldwide.

And the best part?  
It’s **100% free and open source** — built entirely on the Frappe framework.

BTW it named **ERPNext** because it was the cheapest domain name which include the word "ERP" that they could find at the time. (that's the story)

**The different between Frappe and Oracle, SAP, etc?**

Frappe is a **web framework** for building any type of web applications, while Oracle and SAP are **applications** themselves. Frappe provides the tools and infrastructure to build your own applications whatever you want (versatile), whereas Oracle and SAP are complete, ready-to-use solutions for specific business needs only.

Frappe did built ERPNext which is just an application built on top of Frappe framework, but Frappe is not limited to ERP only unlike Oracle and SAP. You can build any type of application you want on top of it no matter how complex it is or what it does.

Oracle and SAP are like pre-built houses, while Frappe is like a construction kit that lets you build whatever you want.

**Prove that Frappe is Powerful and Versatile?**

FRAPPE DID BUILD ERPNEXT!! no need other prove.

**What is the difference between Frappe and other web frameworks?**

Frappe allow the end user to build their own application without coding, while other web frameworks require hard coding, and above and byond the system is very relaiable ,stable, fast, and secure.

In my opinion: With due respect to other frameworks, Frappe is the future of software development.
